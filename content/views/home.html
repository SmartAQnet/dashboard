			The data provided on this website has been collected for research purposes within the SmartAQnet research project funded by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) (funding code: 19F2003). Please note that since the data was collected automatically by various systems and for the most part not validated, the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s5" >disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability </a> associated with the user license (see <a href="/en/funding-institution-and-legal-disclosures">Legal Disclosures</a>)  must be observed.

In particular, we would like to explicitly point out principle-related errors and inaccuracies in the data, since, for example, the sensors used were partly operated by laypersons, deliberately outside the specifications of the manufacturers or were not subjected to calibration. Therefore, data contained should not be regarded as "measurements" in the usual sense. We also do not exclude the possibility of errors when importing external measurements or metadata. In case of doubt, refer directly to the referenced source (that may be explicitly suitable for other purposes). In particular, this data collection in itself is not suitable for monitoring or evaluating the quality of outdoor air at the referenced locations.
